# TODO

- Github

  - Pages for documentation
    - Autogenerate documentation
  - Set up all community guidelines stuff
- Implementation
  - Add `~~~~~^` style markers to diagnostic output
    - Add `cio_glog_column_indicator` to `cionom.c`
  - Add AST and Token list cleanup functions 
    - Ensure they work even after failure to completely tokenize/parse (User calls on failure)
  - Bytecode generation is disgusting
    - Especially with allocations
  - Add comments and docstrings!
  - Hooking into external resolution from user code
  - Treat `\r` as whitespace
  - Don't `grealloc` on pushing a new VM frame
    - Statically allocate based on stack length at startup
    - No heap operations during VM runtime
  - Treat `call FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF` as return
  - Reduce bytecode size
    - Fixed width types
    - Encode instruction type as single bit
      - Use 7 bits to encode offset into routine table/constant pool
- Specification
  - Rewrite semantics for new stuff
